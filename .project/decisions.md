# Decision Log — Brahmadatta AI

Append-only. Never edit history; append a correction instead.

## D-001 · Repository is private · 2026-08-06 · Orchestrator

**Decision** — `Mahatav/brahmadatta-ai` created private.

**Options considered** — public (visibility, judges could browse) vs private (default-safe).

**Pros and cons** — Public would show the work and cost nothing to change later. Private avoids
publishing competition strategy, an unreviewed threat model, and demo target details before the
CEO has chosen to. Flipping private→public later is one command; the reverse does not un-index.

**Cost implications** — none.

**Security implications** — favors private. The repo will accumulate security-testing
methodology and, eventually, evidence artifacts.

**Scalability implications** — none.

**Recommendation** — private now; the CEO can open it at any point.

**Final approval authority** — CEO. Proceeding under the safe default until told otherwise.

## D-002 · `main` is protected · 2026-08-06 · Orchestrator

**Decision** — Branch protection on `main`: PRs required, force-push and deletion blocked,
required approving reviews set to 0, `enforce_admins` off.

**Options considered** — no protection (fast, matches a solo repo) vs protection as the git
workflow doc specifies.

**Pros and cons** — `docs/04-development/36-git-workflow.md` says no direct pushes to `main`,
so protection makes the documented rule real rather than aspirational. Review count is 0 because
the reviewers here are agent seats, not GitHub accounts — the actual review chain is enforced by
`.claude/COMPANY.md` and recorded on the PR, not by GitHub. `enforce_admins` is off so a broken
protection rule can never strand the repo during the 36-hour finale.

**Cost implications** — none.

**Security implications** — mildly positive; history cannot be rewritten.

**Scalability implications** — none.

**Recommendation** — as implemented.

**Final approval authority** — CTO (technical).

## D-003 · Company headcount is dynamic · 2026-08-06 · Orchestrator

**Decision** — Every seat except CEO and orchestrator starts on the bench. Roles are hired when
a phase needs them and retired when its gate passes, logged in `.claude/COMPANY.md` §4.
Concurrency capped at three active implementers.

**Options considered** — a fixed standing roster invoked every phase, vs on-demand hiring.

**Pros and cons** — A standing roster is simpler to reason about but costs a full agent
invocation per role per phase and blurs artifact ownership when two roles touch the same file.
On-demand hiring costs a routing decision each phase, in exchange for far fewer invocations.
The cap on concurrency comes from prior experience on another repo where a full company pass
died mid-implementation on a session limit.

**Cost implications** — materially lower. This is the main reason for the decision.

**Security implications** — neutral. The `cybersecurity` veto is unaffected; it is hired
whenever a gate requires it.

**Scalability implications** — positive; the roster grows by adding bench definitions.

**Recommendation** — as implemented.

**Final approval authority** — CEO (this is how he asked for the company to run).

## D-004 · Four Brahmadatta-specific seats added · 2026-08-06 · Orchestrator

**Decision** — Defined `security-research-engineer`, `compiler-toolchain-engineer`,
`ml-infra-engineer`, and `competition-strategist` in `.claude/agents/`, on the bench.

**Options considered** — stretch the general roster (`backend-developer` writes the fuzzing
worker, `ai-ml-engineer` covers GPU serving, `product-manager` covers submission materials) vs
define specialist seats.

**Pros and cons** — The general roster has no seat that owns a reproducer bar, a sanitizer
build matrix, a `git bisect run` contract, a self-hosted serving stack, or a judging rubric.
Handing those to a generalist means the hard constraints — no external inference API, no
confidence-gated verdicts, no unbenchmarked number quoted as measured — live only in review
comments rather than in the role's own hard rules. Cost is four more files to maintain.

**Cost implications** — none directly; these seats replace general-seat invocations rather than
adding to them.

**Security implications** — positive. `security-research-engineer` builds the product's
analysis capability and is explicitly separated from `cybersecurity`, which reviews *our* code —
so neither reviews its own work.

**Scalability implications** — neutral.

**Recommendation** — as implemented.

**Final approval authority** — CTO (technical).

## D-005 · Intake pre-filled from the doc pack · 2026-08-06 · Orchestrator

**Decision** — `.project/intake.md` was written from `docs/` rather than by interviewing the CEO,
with four genuinely-unanswered items marked DEFERRED and assumptions stated.

**Options considered** — run the standard intake questionnaire vs derive from the pack.

**Pros and cons** — The pack is the CEO's own specification and already answers idea, users,
problem, features, stack, scope, constraints, and schedule shape. Re-asking would be noise
against a standing instruction to interrupt only for decisions that genuinely need him. Risk is
that a derived answer misreads the pack; mitigated by citing the source document for every
answer so any role can check.

**Cost implications** — none.

**Security implications** — none.

**Scalability implications** — none.

**Recommendation** — as implemented. The four deferred items are batched for the CEO rather than
asked one at a time.

**Final approval authority** — CEO.
