## Purpose

Define and operationalize target user personas for the Brahmadatta AI competition MVP on rented GPUs.

## Competition operator
Needs predictable setup, one-command runs, visible stage progress, safe cancellation, and an exportable report.

## Security engineer
Needs reproducible findings, minimized evidence, strict isolation, configurable policy, and minimal patches.

## Repository developer
Needs a reviewable diff, the failing test/reproducer, affected history, and proof that normal behavior remains intact.

## Infrastructure administrator
Needs private networking, quotas, encrypted volumes, secrets isolation, health checks, and automatic GPU shutdown.

## Judge or mentor
Needs a clear novelty story, measured resource use, honest limitations, and evidence independent of model claims.

## Fixed MVP competition decisions

- **Product name:** Brahmadatta AI.
- **Product type:** an authorized, defensive Cyber-Reasoning System for the AI Kavach competition MVP.
- **Architecture:** three evidence-driven tiers: fast deterministic triage, destructive sandbox testing with lightweight patching, and heavy repository-level reasoning only when escalation is justified.
- **Interface:** a dense futuristic armor-command-center dashboard with a central mission core, live telemetry, drill-down panels, and operator controls. The visual language is original and does not copy third-party logos or branded interface assets.
- **Primary workflow:** authorize → ingest → baseline → analyze → correlate → stress-test → patch → verify → export evidence.
- **Compute:** CPU-first processing with self-hosted models on rented GPU infrastructure. Repository content is not sent to an external inference API.
- **MVP target:** C/C++ repositories first; Python support is optional.
- **Verification rule:** a patch is never accepted on model confidence alone. The original reproducer, regression tests, static checks, and renewed fuzzing determine the verdict.
- **Safety boundary:** authorized repositories and isolated environments only; no public-target scanning, no exploit deployment, and no automatic production merge.

## Open decisions / next review

- Assign the final three-person team roles.
- Lock the rented GPU provider and tested model-serving recipe.
- Replace estimated performance targets with benchmark results.
- Confirm the final competition demo repository and fallback recording.
